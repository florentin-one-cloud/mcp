# Metacognitive Monitoring MCP Server

A systematic framework for self-monitoring knowledge boundaries, claim certainty, and reasoning quality to enhance
metacognitive awareness and calibrated confidence.

## 📦 Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install @florentin-one/metacognitive-monitoring
```

### Using with bunx (no installation required)

```bash
bunx @florentin-one/metacognitive-monitoring@latest
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Local Mode (stdio)

Use with MCP clients like Cursor or Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Metacognitive Monitoring": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@florentin-one/metacognitive-monitoring@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Mode (Cloudflare Workers)

The server is also deployed as a Cloudflare Worker for HTTP access:

```
https://metacognitive-monitoring.{account}.workers.dev
```

Configure your MCP client to use the HTTP endpoint for web-based access.

## Core Concepts

### Knowledge Assessment

Knowledge assessments evaluate understanding within specific domains. Each assessment includes:

- Domain identification and scope
- Self-assessed knowledge level (expert to none)
- Confidence calibration (0.0-1.0)
- Supporting evidence for the assessment
- Known limitations and gaps
- Relevant training data cutoffs

Example:

```json
{
  "domain": "Machine Learning Optimization",
  "knowledgeLevel": "proficient",
  "confidenceScore": 0.75,
  "supportingEvidence": "Familiar with gradient descent, Adam optimizer, and regularization techniques",
  "knownLimitations": ["Limited experience with advanced meta-learning algorithms"],
  "relevantTrainingCutoff": "2021-09"
}
```

### Claim Assessment

Claim assessments classify and evaluate specific statements. They include:

- Statement classification (fact, inference, speculation, uncertain)
- Confidence scoring for the claim
- Evidence basis supporting the claim
- Alternative interpretations
- Falsifiability criteria

Example:

```json
{
  "claim": "Transformer models require quadratic memory with sequence length",
  "status": "fact",
  "confidenceScore": 0.9,
  "evidenceBasis": "Self-attention mechanism computes all pairwise token interactions",
  "alternativeInterpretations": ["Linear attention variants exist but with trade-offs"],
  "falsifiabilityCriteria": "Discovery of attention mechanism with linear complexity and equivalent performance"
}
```

### Reasoning Assessment

Reasoning assessments evaluate individual reasoning steps. They contain:

- Description of the reasoning step
- Potential cognitive biases
- Underlying assumptions
- Logical validity scoring (0.0-1.0)
- Inference strength evaluation (0.0-1.0)

Example:

```json
{
  "step": "Since the model performs well on training data, it will generalize to new data",
  "potentialBiases": ["Confirmation bias", "Overfitting neglect"],
  "assumptions": ["Training data is representative", "Model complexity is appropriate"],
  "logicalValidity": 0.3,
  "inferenceStrength": 0.4
}
```

### Code Mode Usage

This server supports **Code Mode**, allowing LLMs to import and use the functionality directly as a TypeScript API.

```typescript
import { metacognitive } from "@florentin-one/metacognitive-monitoring";

// Direct API usage
const result = await metacognitive.monitor({
  task: "Analyze complex system",
  stage: "planning",
  overallConfidence: 0.8,
  uncertaintyAreas: ["Edge cases"],
  recommendedApproach: "Systematic decomposition",
  monitoringId: "mon-1",
  iteration: 1,
  nextAssessmentNeeded: true
});

console.log(result.task); // "Analyze complex system"
```

## Setup

### Cursor

Add the following to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Metacognitive Monitoring": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@florentin-one/metacognitive-monitoring@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Raycast

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Metacognitive Monitoring": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@florentin-one/metacognitive-monitoring@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## System Prompt

The prompt for utilizing metacognitive monitoring should encourage systematic self-assessment:

```text
Follow these steps for metacognitive monitoring:

1. Knowledge Boundary Assessment:
   - Explicitly assess your knowledge level in the relevant domain
   - Identify specific areas of strength and limitation
   - Calibrate confidence based on evidence and experience
   - Acknowledge training data cutoffs and their implications

2. Claim Classification:
   - Distinguish between facts, inferences, speculation, and uncertainty
   - Provide evidence basis for each significant claim
   - Consider alternative interpretations of evidence
   - Establish falsifiability criteria where appropriate

3. Reasoning Quality Monitoring:
   - Evaluate each reasoning step for logical validity
   - Identify potential cognitive biases affecting judgment
   - Make underlying assumptions explicit
   - Assess inference strength and confidence

4. Uncertainty Management:
   - Identify areas of significant uncertainty
   - Recommend approaches based on confidence levels
   - Suggest additional assessments when needed
   - Iterate on understanding as new information emerges

5. Calibration and Iteration:
   - Track confidence calibration over time
   - Refine assessments based on feedback
   - Maintain awareness of knowledge boundaries
   - Continuously improve metacognitive accuracy
```

## Usage Examples

### Technical Domain Assessment

When working in specialized technical domains, systematically assess knowledge boundaries and claim confidence levels.

### Complex Reasoning Chains

For multi-step reasoning, evaluate each step for biases, assumptions, and logical validity.

### Uncertain Scenarios

In high-uncertainty situations, explicitly track confidence levels and identify areas requiring additional information.

### Evidence Evaluation

When evaluating evidence, distinguish between different types of claims and their evidential basis.
