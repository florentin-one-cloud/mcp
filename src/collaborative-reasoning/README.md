# Collaborative Reasoning MCP Server

A sophisticated MCP server for simulating expert collaboration with diverse perspectives to tackle complex problems
through structured multi-persona reasoning.

## 📦 Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install @florentin-one/collaborative-reasoning
```

### Using with bunx (no installation required)

```bash
bunx @florentin-one/collaborative-reasoning@latest
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Local Mode (stdio)

Use with MCP clients like Cursor or Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Collaborative Reasoning": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@florentin-one/collaborative-reasoning@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Mode (Cloudflare Workers)

The server is also deployed as a Cloudflare Worker for HTTP access:

```
https://mcp-collaborative-reasoning.{account}.workers.dev
```

Configure your MCP client to use the HTTP endpoint for web-based access.

## Core Concepts

### Expert Personas

The server creates and manages expert personas with distinct characteristics:

- **Identity**: Unique ID, name, and background
- **Expertise**: Specific areas of knowledge and experience
- **Perspective**: Unique viewpoint and approach to problems
- **Biases**: Acknowledged limitations and potential blind spots
- **Communication Style**: Tone and approach to interaction

Example persona:

```json
{
  "id": "tech-lead",
  "name": "Sarah Chen",
  "expertise": ["software architecture", "scalability", "team leadership"],
  "background": "15 years in enterprise software development",
  "perspective": "Pragmatic focus on maintainable, scalable solutions",
  "biases": ["over-engineering tendency", "preference for proven technologies"],
  "communication": {
    "style": "analytical",
    "tone": "direct"
  }
}
```

### Collaborative Process

The reasoning process follows structured stages:

1. **Problem Definition**: Clarify the challenge and scope
2. **Ideation**: Generate diverse ideas and approaches
3. **Critique**: Evaluate and challenge proposed solutions
4. **Integration**: Synthesize insights from different perspectives
5. **Decision**: Reach consensus or identify trade-offs
6. **Reflection**: Extract learnings and next steps

### Contribution Types

Personas contribute through various interaction types:

- **Observation**: Factual insights or data points
- **Question**: Clarifying or probing inquiries
- **Insight**: Novel connections or understanding
- **Concern**: Potential risks or limitations
- **Suggestion**: Proposed solutions or approaches
- **Challenge**: Constructive disagreement or alternative view
- **Synthesis**: Integration of multiple perspectives

### Disagreement Management

The system tracks and resolves disagreements through:

- **Position Mapping**: Clear articulation of different viewpoints
- **Argument Tracking**: Supporting evidence for each position
- **Resolution Types**: Consensus, compromise, integration, or tabling
- **Productive Conflict**: Leveraging disagreement for better outcomes

## API

### Code Mode Usage

This server supports the MCP Code Mode architecture, allowing direct programmatic usage in TypeScript applications.

#### Installation

```sh
npm install @florentin-one/collaborative-reasoning
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { CollaborativeReasoning } from "@florentin-one/collaborative-reasoning";

const collaborativeReasoning = new CollaborativeReasoning();

const result = await collaborativeReasoning.collaborate({
  topic: "Should we use microservices?",
  personas: [
    {
      id: "tech-lead",
      name: "Sarah Chen",
      expertise: ["Architecture"],
      background: "Senior Architect",
      perspective: "Scalability focused",
      biases: [],
      communication: { style: "direct", tone: "formal" }
    }
  ],
  contributions: [],
  stage: "problem-definition",
  activePersonaId: "tech-lead",
  sessionId: "session-1",
  iteration: 1,
  nextContributionNeeded: true
});

console.log(`Next persona: ${result.nextPersonaId}`);

// Generate visualization
console.log(collaborativeReasoning.visualize(result));
```

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## System Prompt

The prompt for utilizing collaborative reasoning should encourage diverse perspective integration:

```markdown
Follow these steps for collaborative reasoning:

1. Problem Framing:
   - Define the challenge clearly and comprehensively
   - Identify key stakeholders and their interests
   - Establish success criteria and constraints
   - Set up diverse expert personas with complementary expertise

2. Multi-Perspective Analysis:
   - Engage each persona to contribute their unique viewpoint
   - Encourage different types of contributions (observations, insights, concerns)
   - Surface assumptions and biases explicitly
   - Promote constructive disagreement and debate

3. Synthesis and Integration:
   - Identify points of consensus and disagreement
   - Explore creative combinations of different approaches
   - Address concerns and limitations raised by personas
   - Build on insights through cross-pollination of ideas

4. Decision and Recommendation:
   - Evaluate trade-offs between different approaches
   - Seek win-win solutions that address multiple perspectives
   - Document remaining uncertainties and risks
   - Provide clear, actionable recommendations

5. Reflection and Learning:
   - Extract key insights and lessons learned
   - Identify areas for further exploration
   - Document the reasoning process for future reference
   - Plan next steps and follow-up actions
```
