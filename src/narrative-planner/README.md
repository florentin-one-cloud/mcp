# Narrative Planner MCP Server

A structured framework for creating comprehensive three-act story outlines with detailed character development, plot
progression, and thematic elements.

## 📦 Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install @florentin-one/narrative-planner
```

### Using with bunx (no installation required)

```bash
bunx @florentin-one/narrative-planner@latest
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Local Mode (stdio)

Use with MCP clients like Cursor or Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Narrative Planner": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@florentin-one/narrative-planner@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Mode (Cloudflare Workers)

The server is also deployed as a Cloudflare Worker for HTTP access:

```
https://mcp-narrative-planner.{account}.workers.dev
```

Configure your MCP client to use the HTTP endpoint for web-based access.

## Core Concepts

### Three-Act Structure

The narrative planner follows the classical three-act dramatic structure:

- **Act I (Setup)**: Character introduction, world-building, and inciting incident
- **Act II (Confrontation)**: Rising action, obstacles, and character development
- **Act III (Resolution)**: Climax, falling action, and denouement

Example structure:

```json
{
  "act1": {
    "setup": "Introduction of protagonist in their ordinary world",
    "incitingIncident": "Event that disrupts the status quo",
    "plotPoint1": "Decision that launches the main story"
  },
  "act2": {
    "risingAction": "Series of escalating challenges",
    "midpoint": "Major revelation or turning point",
    "plotPoint2": "Moment of crisis leading to climax"
  },
  "act3": {
    "climax": "Final confrontation or resolution",
    "fallingAction": "Consequences of the climax",
    "resolution": "New equilibrium and character growth"
  }
}
```

### Character Development

Character arcs are integrated into the narrative structure with:

- Character motivations and goals
- Internal and external conflicts
- Growth and transformation throughout acts
- Relationship dynamics and interactions

### Thematic Elements

The planner incorporates thematic considerations:

- Central themes and messages
- Symbolic elements and motifs
- Emotional journey and tone
- Genre conventions and expectations

## Setup

### bunx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {

#### bunx with custom settings

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Narrative Planner": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@florentin-one/narrative-planner@latest"],
      "env": {
        "NARRATIVE_STYLE": "detailed",
        "DEFAULT_GENRE": "drama",

    }
  }
}
```

- `NARRATIVE_STYLE`: Level of detail in outlines ("basic" | "detailed" | "comprehensive")
- `DEFAULT_GENRE`: Default genre when not specified ("drama" | "comedy" | "thriller" | "romance" | "fantasy" | "sci-fi")
- `OUTLINE_DEPTH`: Depth of structural analysis ("simple" | "standard" | "comprehensive")

## System Prompt

The prompt for utilizing narrative planning should encourage structured storytelling:

```markdown
Follow these steps for narrative planning:

1. Story Foundation:
   - Define core premise and central conflict
   - Establish protagonist goals and motivations
   - Identify primary themes and messages

2. Three-Act Development:
   - Structure Act I setup with clear inciting incident
   - Build Act II confrontation with escalating stakes
   - Design Act III resolution with satisfying conclusion

3. Character Integration:
   - Align character arcs with plot progression
   - Ensure character growth drives story forward
   - Balance internal and external conflicts

4. Thematic Coherence:
   - Weave themes throughout all three acts
   - Use plot events to explore central messages
   - Maintain consistent tone and emotional journey
```

## Example

```typescript
// Create a comprehensive story outline
const storyOutline = await narrativePlanner({
