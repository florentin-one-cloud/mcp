## Core Concepts

### Scientific Inquiry Process

The server implements a structured approach to scientific reasoning:

- **Observation**: Systematic data collection and pattern recognition
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Creating testable, falsifiable predictions
- **Experimental Design**: Structured methodology with proper controls
- **Data Analysis**: Systematic evaluation of experimental results
- **Conclusion Drawing**: Evidence-based reasoning and interpretation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Hypothesis revision based on findings

Example scientific inquiry:

```json
{
  "inquiry": {
    "question": "Does caffeine consumption affect cognitive performance?",
    "hypothesis": "Moderate caffeine intake (100-200mg) improves reaction time and attention span",
    "variables": {
      "independent": ["caffeine dosage"],
      "dependent": ["reaction time", "attention span", "accuracy"],
      "controlled": ["age", "sleep duration", "time of day", "environment"]
    },
    "predictions": [
      "Reaction time will decrease by 10-15% with moderate caffeine",
      "Attention span will increase by 20-30% during sustained tasks"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hypothesis Development

Hypotheses are structured with specific criteria:

- **Testability**: Can be empirically evaluated
- **Falsifiability**: Can potentially be proven wrong
- **Specificity**: Clear, measurable predictions
- **Scope**: Defined boundaries and limitations

### Experimental Design

Experiments follow rigorous design principles:

- **Control Groups**: Proper baseline comparisons
- **Variable Isolation**: Single factor manipulation
- **Replication**: Multiple trials for reliability
- **Randomization**: Bias reduction strategies
- **Blinding**: Observer and participant bias control

### Data Analysis Framework

Systematic approach to result interpretation:

- **Statistical Significance**: Proper significance testing
- **Effect Size**: Practical significance assessment
- **Confidence Intervals**: Uncertainty quantification
- **Alternative Explanations**: Confounding factor analysis

- Alternative explanations explored and rejected

## Usage Examples

### Causal Analysis

When attempting to determine cause-effect relationships, the model can systematically work through alternative
explanations and evidence evaluation.

### Technical Troubleshooting

For diagnosing problems, the model can generate competing hypotheses about failure causes and design tests to
differentiate between them.

### Literature Review

When synthesizing research findings, the model can systematically evaluate evidence quality and competing explanations.

### Health Diagnosis

For medical reasoning, the model can track hypothesis confidence for different conditions based on symptoms and test
results.
